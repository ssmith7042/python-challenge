# python-challenge
In this challenge there are two sets of data stored in csv files.  For each set of data I created a python file called main.py to read the csv files, analyze the data, and output analysis both in the terminal and in a new text file
In the PyBank folder, the Python script analyzes the csv file and outputs the following information:
The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
In the PyPoll folder, the Python script analyzes the csv file and outputs the following information:
The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
